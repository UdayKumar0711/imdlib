CF conventions
==========================

NetCDF File Convention
-----------------------

The IMDLIB produces netCDF (network Common Data Form) based final output. It is the most common data format in climate science and hydrological studies. The netCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions, Version 1.7, has been adopted by IMDLIB for its efficient and consistent use with other standard netCDF based tool/applications. The EPSG:4326 coordinate reference systems (CRS) are considered in the CF naming convention. They are vital for the function to_geotiff to work correctly. For more information on the CF convention, users must visit CF Conventions Home Page and xarray & CF integration resources.
